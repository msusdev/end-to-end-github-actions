# Build end-to-end CI/CD capabilities directly in GitHub

With GitHub Actions, you can create and set up workflows in your repository to build, test, and deploy your code to Azure. This webinar training series is for teams looking to build end-to-end continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) capabilities directly in their GitHub repositories.

We’ll show you how to create custom CI workflows using GitHub Actions that automate building and testing your code so that you can get immediate feedback on code changes to detect and resolve bugs faster, saving you time.

To automate the deployment process and help to deploy tested, stable code changes to customers more quickly, we’ll also show you how to use GitHub Actions to create custom CD workflows.
